# Notes

## Bootstrapping

- Make dot word (`.`)
- Make `header` word (at least input)
- Do number parsing and echo
- Make `find` word and search dictionary
- Make `execute` word and, well, execute words
- Add `state` word
- Compile/push numbers depending on `state`
  - Start with pushing numbers (`: foo 42 ;`)
- Compile/execute words depending on `state` and immediate flag
- Make `create` and `immediate`
- Make colon (`:`) and semicolon (`;`)
- Away you go!
