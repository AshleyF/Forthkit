# Forthkit

Inspired by Lispkit, build your own Forth from scratch.

1) [Write an interpreter (in Python)](./interpreter/). Similar to Chuck Moore's first punch card interpreter.
2) Play with it!
    * Write a [console Pixel library](./library/pixels/) using Unicode Braille characters
    * Use this to do [Turtle Graphics](./library/turtle/)!
